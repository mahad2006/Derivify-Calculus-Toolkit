¬† A modern Android toolkit for mastering calculus ‚Äî built with Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and a custom symbolic math engine.
</p>

---

This project began as a final assignment for my second-semester **Multi-Variable Calculus** course. The requirement was to build something related to our curriculum, but I saw it as an opportunity to build a truly useful, high-quality tool for other students.

**Derivify** is the result: a native Android application designed to be an all-in-one toolkit for university-level calculus. It's not just a calculator; it's a learning companion built with a modern tech stack‚Äî100% Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.

## Features

The app is built around two core ideas: providing powerful tools for solving problems and offering an interactive way to practice and test your knowledge.

### The Calculators
Derivify can handle a range of complex multi-variable calculus operations:

* **Partial Derivatives:** Solves partial derivatives for functions with multiple variables.
* **Gradients:** Instantly finds the gradient vector `‚àáf` of a function.
* **Directional Derivatives:** Calculates the rate of change in the direction of a given vector.

### The Calculus Quiz
To move beyond simple calculation, I built an interactive quiz feature with a large, university-level question bank. It‚Äôs designed to genuinely test your understanding, not just your memorization.

It features four difficulty levels:

* **Easy:** A review of foundational rules (Power Rule, Product Rule, etc.).
* **Medium:** A mix of chain rules, implicit differentiation, and inverse trig.
* **Hard:** Multi-variable topics like partial derivatives and gradients.
* **Nightmare:** A true challenge ‚Äî mixed partials, directional derivatives, and more.

## üèóÔ∏è How It's Built

This project was an exercise in building a modern, robust Android application from the ground up.

* **Language:** 100% **Kotlin**
* **User Interface:** **Jetpack Compose** with **Material 3** for a fully declarative, modern UI
* **Architecture:** **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** for a clean separation between UI and logic
* **State Management:** Using `ViewModels` and `MutableState` for efficient UI reactivity

### Key Technical Feature: Custom Math Engine
The core of this application is a **custom-built symbolic differentiation engine**. Instead of relying on external libraries, this engine:
1.  **Parses** user-input functions into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
2.  **Recursively applies** calculus rules (Power, Product, Chain Rule, etc.) to the tree.
3.  **Generates** an exact, analytical derivative, not a numerical approximation.
