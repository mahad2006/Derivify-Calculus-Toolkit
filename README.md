<p align="center">
  A modern Android toolkit for mastering calculus ‚Äî built with Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and a custom math engine.
</p>

---

This project began as a final assignment for my second-semester **Multi-Variable Calculus** course. The requirement was to build something related to our curriculum, but I saw it as an opportunity to build a truly useful, high-quality tool for other students.

**Derivify** is the result: a native Android application designed to be an all-in-one toolkit for university-level calculus.  
It's not just a calculator; it's a learning companion built with a modern tech stack‚Äî100% Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.

## What It Does

The app is built around two core ideas: providing powerful tools for solving problems and offering an interactive way to practice and test your knowledge.

### The Calculators
Derivify can handle a range of complex multi-variable calculus operations:

* **Partial Derivatives:** Solves partial derivatives for functions with multiple variables.  
* **Gradients:** Instantly finds the gradient vector `‚àáf` of a function.  
* **Directional Derivatives:** Calculates the rate of change in the direction of a given vector.  

### The Calculus Quiz
To move beyond simple calculation, I built an interactive quiz feature with a large, university-level question bank.  
It‚Äôs designed to genuinely test your understanding, not just your memorization.

It features four difficulty levels:

* **Easy:** A review of foundational rules (Power Rule, Product Rule, etc.).  
* **Medium:** A mix of chain rules, implicit differentiation, and inverse trig.  
* **Hard:** Multi-variable topics like partial derivatives and gradients.  
* **Nightmare:** A true challenge ‚Äî mixed partials, directional derivatives, and more.

## üèóÔ∏è How It's Built

This project was an exercise in building a modern, robust Android application from the ground up.

* **Language:** 100% **Kotlin**  
* **User Interface:** **Jetpack Compose** with **Material 3** for a fully declarative, modern UI  
* **Architecture:** **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** for a clean separation between UI and logic  
* **State Management:** Using `ViewModels` and `MutableState` for efficient UI reactivity  
* **Math Engine:** Custom-built symbolic differentiation engine ‚Äî parses user functions into expression trees and recursively applies calculus rules (Power, Product, Chain Rule) for exact analytical results

## What's Next: Future Roadmap

Derivify is still in active development.  
Next steps include expanding the toolkit with more advanced calculus utilities:

* **New Calculators:**
  * Maxima & Minima (Second Partial Derivative Test)
  * Linear Approximation & Tangent Planes
  * Vector Field Visualization
* **Step-by-Step Solutions:** Show *how* the derivative was calculated  
* **3D Graph Plotting:** Visualize the analyzed functions
